## Project: Creating Customer Segments

Welcome to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")
```

    Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.
    

## Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.


```python
# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())
```

### Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.


```python
#Finding indices with significant variations
#cafe
milk_q3=7190.25
display(data.loc[data.Milk > milk_q3,:].head())
```

### Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  

* What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?

**Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:

* Fresh: 12000.2977
* Milk: 5796.2
* Grocery: 3071.9
* Detergents_paper: 2881.4
* Delicatessen: 1524.8

Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be? 


**Answer:**

Assumptions:
 
*    Fresh: Fresh fruits and vegatables
*    Milk: Milk and dairy products.
*    Grocery: All packaged food items such as flour, sugar, and tinned foods
*    Frozen: Packaged frozen products
*    Detergents_Paper: Detergents and washing up liquids, and paper products (paper plates, napkins, etc.)
*    Delicatessen: ready-to-eat cooked meats and cheeses

**Index :** 9 

|Fresh   |Milk     |Grocery  |	   Frozen|     Detergents_Paper|   Delicatessen|
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 	 6006|    11093|    18881|       1159|                 7425|           2098|


This could be a ***coffee shop*** serving some food or snacks as the **spending on milk, groceries and detergents_paper is high** and the **spending on frozen, fresh and delicatessen is below their respective means.**

**Index :** 74

|Fresh   |Milk     |Grocery  |	   Frozen|     Detergents_Paper|   Delicatessen|
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 	 8352|     2820|     1293|        779|                  656|            144|

This could be a ***supermarket*** as the **spending of each category is either below or near to their respective mean.**

**Index :** 14

|Fresh   |Milk     |Grocery  |	   Frozen|     Detergents_Paper|   Delicatessen|
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 	24653|     9465|    12091|        294|                 5058|           2168|

This could be ***fine dining restaurant*** where little to no use of any frozen products is made as the **most of the spending is on fresh, milk, groceries and detergents_paper** and **very low on frozen**

### Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
 - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
 - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
 - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data.drop(['Delicatessen'], axis=1)
target_data = data['Delicatessen']

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
# Set a random state.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, target_data, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42).fit(X_train,y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
score = regressor.score(X_test,y_test)

print("Regression Score:",score)
```

    Regression Score: -2.2547115372
    

### Question 2

* Which feature did you attempt to predict? 
* What was the reported prediction score? 
* Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?

**Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

**Answer:**

* The feature "Detergents_Paper" was attempted to predict
* The reported score is -2.255
* The reported score is negative so that means Delicatessen is hard to predict using other features and so it is one of the important features which should be taken into consideration

### Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.


```python
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

    C:\Users\Paavan Patel\AppData\Local\conda\conda\envs\sign-language-gpu\lib\site-packages\ipykernel_launcher.py:2: FutureWarning: pandas.scatter_matrix is deprecated. Use pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix instead
      
    


![png](output_18_1.png)


### Question 3
* Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
* Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? 
* Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? 
* How is the data for those features distributed?

**Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) (the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: `data.corr()`) to gain further insight.


```python
import seaborn as sns
co_rel=data.corr(method='pearson')
sns.heatmap(co_rel)
```

**Answer:**

* From the scatter matrix as well as the heatmap it can be oberserved that **(Detergents_Paper, Grocery)** seems to show the strongest correlation followed by **(Grocery, Milk)** and **(Detergents_Paper, Milk)**.
* This also confirms my initial suspicions that **Delicatessen does not show any correlations** with other features at all making it one of the important features to consider while making prediction.
* The data is **highly skewed** and is not normally distributed.


## Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

### Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
 - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.


```python
# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

    C:\Users\Paavan Patel\AppData\Local\conda\conda\envs\sign-language-gpu\lib\site-packages\ipykernel_launcher.py:8: FutureWarning: pandas.scatter_matrix is deprecated. Use pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix instead

### Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.


```python
# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)
```

### Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
 - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
 - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
 - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.

**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.


```python
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature],25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature],75)
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step = 1.5 * (Q3-Q1)
    
    # Display the outliers
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = [65,66,75,128,154]

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)
```

### Question 4
* Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? 
* Should these data points be removed from the dataset? 
* If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.

** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

**Answer:** 
* Yes there were points which were considered outliers in more than one feature
* Yes, these points should be removed from the dataset.
* The points added to the outliers list were with the index 65, 66,75,128 and 154 because these points were detected as outliers in atleast 2 features, which i could make out by skimming through the list. If a point is considered an outlier in more than one feature, the propability of it being an outlier increases drastically and therefore the points mentioned above were added to the outliers list.

    Also k-means is largely affected by the outliers so it is a good practise to remove outliers if we want to apply k-means on the data.

## Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

### Implementation: PCA

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=6).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)

ex_var=pca.explained_variance_ratio_
ex_var2=sum(ex_var[i] for i in range(2))
ex_var4=sum(ex_var[i] for i in range(4))
print("Total Variance of first 2 components:",ex_var2)
print("Total Variance of first 4 components:",ex_var4)
```

    Total Variance of first 2 components: 0.706817230807
    Total Variance of first 4 components: 0.931090109951
    


![png](output_33_1.png)


### Question 5

* How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component? 
* How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components? 
* Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.

**Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

**Answer:**

* *1st component : 43.80 %*
* *2nd component : 27.00 %*
    * **Total:70.79 %**

* *3rd component : 12.22 %*
* *4th component : 10.09 %*
    * **Total:93.10 %**
    
* The PC1 is well represented by Detergents_Paper, Grocery and Milk only. This also explains their strong correlation with each other as disccused in Question 3.
* The PC2 increases with the features which were badly represented in PC1, i.e. Fresh, Delicatessen and Frozen. Also the features Detergents_Paper, Milk and Grocery does not increase in PC2.
* The PC3 increases with only Fresh and Delicatessen, it also increases in Frozen but not much.
* In PC4, there is a large increase in Frozen followed by Delicatessen

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))

### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
```

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.


```python
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
```

## Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.


```python
# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x17bc32a5438>




![png](output_43_1.png)


### Observation

Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 

From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

## Clustering

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

### Question 6

* What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? 
* What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? 
* Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?

** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

**Answer:**

* K-means:
    * Hard Clustering
        * It requires a clear boundary between two different clusters
    * Advantages
        * Simple to implement
        * Easy to interpret results
        * Fast and efficient computationally
        * Works even if some assumptions are broken
    * Disadvanatges
        * Need to specify no of clusters beforehand
        * Affected by outliers

* GMM:
    * Soft Clustering
        * Points can exist closely there is no restriction as such in terms of distance
    * Advantages
        * It is more flexible in terms of cluster covariance
        * It can accomodate mixed membership
        * Can carve out clusters of any shape
    * Disadvantages
        * It can fail to work upon higher dimensionality
        * Difficult to interpret
        
* I think GMM is the best bet as from knowledge about the dataset, the data points are ddensely packed and there is no clear and distant space between clusters,therefore they most likely appear of the mixed membership type. To cluster such data GMM is more appropriate than K-means.

### Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
 - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
 - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
 - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
 - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.


```python
from sklearn.mixture import GMM
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
cluster_list = [2,3,4,5]

print("Silhouette Scores")
for i in cluster_list:
    # TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
    clusterer = GMM(n_components=i).fit(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.means_

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

    # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)
    
    print(i," Clusters: ",score)

# Running this code again with the no of clusters having the best siloutte score
best_score_n_cluster=2
# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
clusterer = GMM(n_components=best_score_n_cluster).fit(reduced_data)

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# TODO: Find the cluster centers
centers = clusterer.means_

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds)

 
```

    Silhouette Scores
    2  Clusters:  0.411818864386
    3  Clusters:  0.373560747175
    4  Clusters:  0.329440981865
    5  Clusters:  0.295441470747
    

### Question 7

* Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. 
* Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?

**Answer:**
* The silouette scores are the following:
    * 2  Clusters:  0.411818864386
    * 3  Clusters:  0.373560747175
    * 4  Clusters:  0.329440981865
    * 5  Clusters:  0.295441470747
* Of these the 2 clusters has the best silhouette score


### Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 


```python
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```


![png](output_53_0.png)


### Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
 - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.



```python
# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)
```

### Question 8

* Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?

**Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

**Answer:**

* **Cluster 0** : This cluster belongs to some ***type of restaurant*** which is evident from the higher than average or close to average spendings on Grocery, Milk and Detergents_Paper.
* **Cluster 1** : This cluster belongs to ***convenience store or a super market*** which is evident from it's below average spendings on near about average spendings in every category.

### Question 9

* For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it? 
* Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*

Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.


```python
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)
```

    Sample point 0 predicted to be in Cluster 0
    Sample point 1 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 2 predicted to be in Cluster 0
    

**Answer:**
* Cluster 0: Some type of restaurant
* Cluster 1: Super market

Best Representation for samples
* Sample 0: Cluster 0
* Sample 1: Cluster 1
* Sample 2: Cluster 0

  Yes the predictions are consistent with intial assumptions.

## Conclusion

In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

### Question 10
Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. 

* How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*

**Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

**Answer:**

The wholesale distributor needs to determine the different customer segments prior to applying A/B tests for changing its delivery service. After determining the customer segments he can apply this change to a small portion of each segments and take feedback from them.

For example, we have got two cluster, cluster 0(restaurants), they may react negatively to this change as the freshness of the food matters a lot to them. Changing it to 3 days would force them to keep more food items in stock, which may results in spoiling of the food and also affect the quality of the food. Whereas supermarkets may react positevely to this as they have enough enough storage space and also freshness is not a concern. They could cut down logistics cost by increasing their quantity of food items per delivery.

### Question 11
Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
* How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?

**Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

**Answer:**

The wholesale distributor can apply a supervised learning algorithm (such as Decision Tree or SVC or Neural Network etc) on the initial data as inputs and use the customer segment(obtained using GMM clustering) as the target variable to train the model.

Using this model, he can predict for each new customer whether the 3 days per week or 5 day per week delivery is more appropriate.

### Visualizing Underlying Distributions

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.


```python
# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
vs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)
```

### Question 12

* How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? 
* Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? 
* Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

**Answer:**

The clustering algorithm chosen and number of clusters closely match the underlying distribution but the cluster which i thought to the restaurant cluster and retailer cluster are not consistent with the given distribution.
The points on the extreme left and right can be classified as purely retail or hotels/restaurants/cafes.
